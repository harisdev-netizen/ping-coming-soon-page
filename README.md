## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design with media queries

### What I learned

1. **Font Setup Using Google Fonts:**
Integrated the `Libre Franklin` font using the `@import` method to establish a professional and clean typography style.
<br>

2. **Custom CSS Variables:**
Set up reusable color variables in :root, such as `--color-text-primary` and `--color-button-primary`, for a consistent color theme that is easy to manage and update across the project.
<br>

3. **Flexbox for Layout Structure:**
Flexbox for Centering and Layout: Used Flexbox to structure elements within the `.page`, `.form`, and `.footer__social` classes for responsive centering and alignment.
<br>

4. **Button Hover Effect:**
Added a hover effect on the submit button, changing the background to transparent and adjusting the text color, creating a visually appealing feedback for user interaction.
<br>

5. **Responsive Design:**
Ensured responsive styles using media queries, making the layout and font sizes adaptable for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Adjustments include stacking the form elements vertically on smaller screens for enhanced usability.
<br>

6. **Social Icons Hover Effect:**
Styled social icons with a hover effect that changes the background color, adding a modern touch and improving user engagement with the footer.

**Enjoy building and customizing! ðŸš€**
